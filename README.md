# 🎨 Thumbnail Designs — Canva

Welcome to the **Thumbnail Designs - Canva** repository! 

This repo serves as a centralized collection of custom thumbnails created using Canva.

These thumbnails are designed for use across platforms such as YouTube, blogs, and other digital content projects.


This repository contains only the thumbnail image files. Each file is:

- ✅ Created and exported from Canva

- 📐 Optimized for 16:9 ratio (1920x1080 by default)

- 🏷️ Named according to content or topic relevance

> Note: No source Canva project links or design elements are included here — just the final exported thumbnails.

## 📸 Thumbnail Previews

To preview thumbnails, simply browse the repository's file list or switch to the "Images" tab (if available in your Git client or viewer).

## ✍️ Usage

You are welcome to:

- ✅ Use these thumbnails in your own video or blog projects

- ✅ Modify them to fit your needs

- ❌ Do not sell or redistribute the thumbnails as-is without permission
